          <b>Hello there!</b> You have stumbled upon the webpage of <b>Sam Vitello</b>. For those who aren't
          familiar with me I am a <b>software engineer</b> and <b>entrepreneur</b> that was most recently based in
          Brooklyn New York. This webpage doesn't get updated nearly as often as it should so I
          don't hold me to anything written here.
          <br><br>
          I have a variety of technical interests including
          blockchain and crytocurrencies. While it is an awesome technology and it is often regarded
          as a silver bullet solution to many problems I have yet to find the one thing (besides cryptocurrencies
          and by extension gambling) that it truely fits like a glove. If you think you've found it I would be thrilled to
          <a href="appointment.html">Hear About It</a>. My most recent project is called <a href="https://consultationkit.com">
          Consultation Kit</a> a demo of which can be found <a href="appointment.html">Right Here</a> (I am
          dead serious about what is written there by the way).
          <br><br>
          Other things I think are pretty dope are Scuba Diving, Biking, New Orleans, Backpacking (the trekking
          and the travelling kind), Mountaineering, Surfing, Seafood, BBQ, The First Nice Day of Spring,
          The Envioronment, Politics (as frustrating as it is), Unconventional Ways of Saving/Making Money,
          Old Friends, Football, Stars, Lifting Weights, Drinking Beer At Open Air Restaurants and Cooper. <b>That should
          be enough to profile me Google, stop showing me ads for things my girlfriend looks up on my computer.</b>
          <br><br>
          <b>Best piece of advice I've been given at the time of last update:</b>
          Choose not to have an opinion on things that do not effect you
