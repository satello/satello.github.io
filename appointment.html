          I feel that this concept deserves a bit of an explaination as it is somewhat unconventional.
          <b>First off I want to ensure you than any appointment booked through this widget will guarantee a phone
          conversation with me.</b> Now to explain why you should pay to speak with me: The cliche goes Time is Money.
          I recieve a decent amount of emails and phone calls from recruiters via LinkedIn and services I have given
          out my resume to and it has started to clog my inbox enough and suck my time that I no longer
          check LinkedIn and refuse to answer phone calls from unknown numbers. It's not that I don't appreciate
          hearing about new opportunities, it is moreso that many of these coorespondences are about things
          that I am either not qualified for or not interested in so I am attempting to weed out some of the noise
          by no longer making it "free" to contact me. It will also guarantee you that I am incentivized to take what
          you are trying to tell me or sell me seriously. This isn't exclusive to recruiters either,
          if you are an advertiser and want to try to sell me something or a random person who
          wants to pitch a product idea to me or listen to me babble about blockchain for 15 minutes I will not turn down
          any attempt to contact me through this widget.
          <br><br>
          Caveat: Life happens and while I guarantee you that you will get your 15 minutes I might have to reschedule with
          you if something comes up during the booked time slot.
